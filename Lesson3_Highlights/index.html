            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is the user management of changes to documents, computer programs, websites, and other miscellaneous collections of information. Version control systems are the tools that help software developers and workers in a team manage the changes made to source code over time. Version control systems allow people to make changes to files, code, or documentation at the same time with the ability to see who made what changes. Version control systems allow us to go back in source code or a file see what the file was like at an earlier time. Version Control Systems are interesting to me because they help the user better organize his or her information. It is also interesting because people can work on the same file or document and see who made what changes. Version control systems are important to this course because we will learn how to use a vcs such as git hub to manage our files.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a place that data or information is stored on your local machine. An example would be your Git hub local repository. Your Git hub local repository is where you make local changes to documents, typically this local repository is located on your computer or machine. A local repository is where you want to make changes and work on your documents before you push them to the remote repository. This understanding of a local repository will make more sense when we get in deep with Git hub and some of the interactions we will make between our local repository and remote repository. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository stores the information that you pushed from your local repository. An example of would be pushing code from your local repository to your remote repository. The code you were working on and storing in your local will now exist on Git hubâ€™s server remote. Remote repositories are versions of your documents or projects that are hosted on the internet for example through Git hub, or a network somewhere. The cool thing about remote repositories is the ability to push data to and from the remote. If working on a group project pushing new information from your local to remote repository is a very vital concept to understand.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed version control systems allows software developers to work on a project simultaneously without them having to share a common network. The distributed version control system takes a peer-to-peer approach when it comes to version control. The distributed version control system synchronizes by exchanging patches or sets of changes from peer to peer. The cool thing about distributed version control systems is the ability for members of a project to work on the same file and have the changes incorporated within the file. This allows members to have an easier time seeing what changes were made and who made them.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Hub </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a way to store and manage data and information in a very accessible manner. Git stores data in a different manner compared to other version control systems. Git thinks of data more in the sense of a snapshot of miniature filesystems. When you commit or save your project in Git, it takes a snap of what the file looks like at that exact moment and stores it in reference. If no changes are made to the file, Git will not save the file again but link it to the original snapshot for better efficiency. The coolest thing about Git is the ability to organize and maintain your projects information in a way that allows efficient work flow. </p>
